Android Application

SWEN303 at Victoria University project in UI Design.
Was also an exercise in learning Google native API's for myself.

Dependencies:
Google Maps app dependencies. This project supports Gingerbread so you will need the old google app project in the same workspace as Eclipse when you compile.
